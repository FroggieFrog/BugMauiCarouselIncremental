# BugMauiCarouselIncremental

The `RemainingItemsThresholdReachedCommand` of the `CarouselView` is not fired when running in Android (14).

When running in Windows, everything is working as it should.

**Tested MAUI version: 8.0.82**

*The repro is based on the [MAUI samples](https://github.com/dotnet/maui-samples) repository.*
